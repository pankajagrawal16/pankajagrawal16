### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Developer at heart working as Senior Solutions Architect @aws. Currently working with different customers across Nordics, helping them to make best use of AWS services and accelerate their journey to cloud. In my spare time, I enjoy running into the woods and loves to learn new technical skills. I am quite passionate about DevOps and serverless technologies in general.
