### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am Developer at heart, working as Principal Customer Engineer at @Microsoft**

Working with different customers across Nordics, helping them to make best use of Cloud native technologies and accelerate their journey to cloud. In my spare time, I enjoy running into the woods and love to learn new technical skills. I am quite passionate about DevOps and serverless technologies in general.
